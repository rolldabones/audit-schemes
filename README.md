audit-schemes

I use the ForHumanity audit schemes for both pre-audit consulting and audit. They are comprehensive, kept up-to-date, and consistently high quality.

What the ForHumanity schemes are

ForHumanity’s audit schemes are designed as detailed certification criteria catalogues intended to be assessed on a binary basis: compliant or non-compliant. The schemes are explicitly tied to a defined target of evaluation and mapped to applicable legal and regulatory requirements. In use, auditors test each criterion with evidence, interviews, and technical review, then issue a certification decision for the defined scope based on whether the criteria are satisfied.

How this differs from common AI governance frameworks

This design differs from most other AI governance frameworks.
	
	•	ISO/IEC 42001 is a management system standard focused on establishing, operating, and continuously improving an AI management system, including governance structures, risk management processes, and continual improvement loops.
	•	NIST AI Risk Management Framework provides flexible functions and outcomes to help organizations manage AI risk across the lifecycle.

Both are built to be adapted to an organization’s context and to operate as a system of governance practices, not as a single prescriptive pass/fail catalogue for a specific system.

How this differs from many commercial “AI audits”

Commercial “AI audits” and many bias audit programs often focus on maturity scoring, program assessments, or statistical fairness testing for particular models.

ForHumanity’s schemes aim for broader coverage across the operational stack:
	
	•	Governance and documentation
	•	Risk management and oversight
	•	Technical controls
	•	Cybersecurity and privacy controls
	•	Harm mitigation

Criteria are structured so a “No” is unambiguous and traceable to evidence.

Institutional differentiator

A second differentiator is institutional. ForHumanity operates as a non-profit scheme owner and positions its criteria development as open and crowd-developed. It separates roles across:
	
	1.	Scheme ownership and maintenance
	2.	Independent certification bodies licensed to use the schemes
	3.	Individually certified auditors trained and examined against scheme requirements

That separation is meant to support independence, repeatability, and external credibility while keeping the audit criteria stable and transparent.

Practical operating model

In practice, an organization can implement ISO/IEC 42001 and NIST-style frameworks as the foundation of an internal AI governance and risk management system, then layer ForHumanity’s schemes on top when it needs a legally aligned, third-party certification with clear binary outcomes and an external signal of conformance.

My ForHumanity certifications (FHCA)

I am a certified ForHumanity auditor, and have qualified for all of the following certifications:
	
	•	Foundations of Independent Audit of AI Systems
	•	CORE AAA Governance FHCA
	•	New York City AEDT Bias Audit FHCA
	•	India Digital Personal Data Protection FHCA
	•	EU GDPR FHCA
	•	Digital Services Act FHCA
	•	EU AI Act FHCA
	•	Cybersecurity FHCA
	•	Children’s Code FHCA

I have also qualified as a Trained Executive in:
	
	•	Algorithm Ethics - Ethics Committee Expert
	•	FH Risk Management Framework

I have a number of other qualifications and certifications related to AI and algorithm audit, but I rely on the complete set of ForHumanity schemes and recommend them highly.

Where to learn more (official sources)

People can learn about ForHumanity and its certifications primarily from ForHumanity’s own sites, which host both the organizational overview and the detailed certification information.
	
	•	The main organizational entry point is the ForHumanity home page, which explains the mission, independent audit approach, and high-level activities.
	•	The certifications home page provides an overview of available certifications, from introductory courses to the ForHumanity Certified Auditor (FHCA) “gold standard,” and links to exams, certified people, and licensees.
	•	The ForHumanity AI Education and Training Center (University) page explains how to register for courses such as Foundations of Independent Audit of AI Systems and scheme-specific trainings that lead to certifications.
	•	The learning management and certification portal provides practical detail on course content, exam logistics, and digital badges.
